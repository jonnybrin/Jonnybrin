<p style="padding-top:20px;">I'm a front-end web developer who is passionate about making engaging and easy to use websites. I love building Wordpress sites, making my own custom themes and designing my own images in Adobe XD and Photoshop. I really enjoy working as part of a team and currently work as a front-end developer at a digital agency in Northampton.</p>
